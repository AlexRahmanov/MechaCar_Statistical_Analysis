# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

# Project Overview
For this project we perform statistical testing in programming language R for MechaCar car company.
Statistical tests provide data-based insight on the company performance and suggest additional testing for comparison of MechaCar company against its competition.

# Resources
1. MechaCar_mpg.csv
2. Suspension_Coil.csv

# Software
1. RStudio

# Deliverable 1
Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle.

# Deliverable 2
Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots.

# Deliverable 3
T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Perform t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

# Deliverable 4
# Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
One feature that people are interested in, is when they are buying a car. There is how much horsepower the car has. I think horsepower, mpg and how large the engine is are 3 factors that go into consumer decision making. We can use our tests to see if our MechaCar is much different from the competiton. We can make a null hypothesis stating that it is not different from the competition and our Alternative would be the opposite. To do this we will need to use our t-test after collecting data from different types of competitor vehicles. Our t-test will be comparing the population of all types of competitor vehicles.

# Metrics
1. Driving system (2-wheel, 4-wheel)
2. Fuel Capacity / Fuel type (Electric, Hybrid, Gasoline)
3. MPG (Gasoline Efficiency)

# In order to run this statistical test, we need the data from:
1. vehicle ID
2. exhaust system emissions data
3. transmission efficiency data

# Hypothesis
Is the MechaCar fuel efficiency performance adequately priced based on its performance or not.

# Statistical Tests
Conducting a multiple linear regression to determine the metrics that have the most significant correlation and predictability with the best fuel efficiency and its impact on the vehicle price.
